## Branching Strategy

For every new feature or bug fix, create a new branch from the latest `master` branch. Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the purpose of the change.

### Branch Naming

Use the following naming convention for branches:

- For a new feature: `feature/short-feature-description`
- For a bug fix: `fix/short-bugfix-description`

## Pull Requests

Once your changes are ready to be merged back into the `master` branch, submit a pull request (PR). All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one project maintainer before being merged.

### PR Guidelines

- Clearly describe the changes made in the PR and provide an explanation for why these changes are necessary.
- Reference any related issues or pull requests.
- Ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards and guidelines.
- Make sure that your changes do not introduce new bugs or break existing functionality.
- Ensure your branch is up to date with the `master` branch to avoid merge conflicts.

### PR Review Process

Project maintainers will review your PR as soon as possible. They may ask for changes or provide feedback on your proposed changes. To ensure a timely review process, please respond to any feedback and update your PR accordingly.

## Questions or Suggestions

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding the contribution process, please feel free to reach out to the project maintainers or open an issue on the project repository.
